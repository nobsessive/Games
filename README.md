Fundamental algorithms, typically characterized by graph searching, is fundamental to alg. design.
Yet, the inclusion of this is deep and tremendous. Even attempts, to solve realistic problems that are 
considerered to be open questions theoretically, are included. e.g. approximation to NP problems.
Thus training is the only way to shape programming skill about this.

This project consists of a series of games, puzzles, math problems that are funny and tricky.
